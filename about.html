    My main goal in life is to engineer technological experiences that are both enticing to a consumer and exciting as a developer.
  </p>
  <p>
    To create an immutably positive user experience, their predilections are paramount. I craft solutions designed to make their
    lives easier, painless, and ultimately more simple. This way users can spend more time focused on the things that matter
    most to them.
  </p>
  What matters most to me is enjoying life as a holistic developer. This over arcing drive is why I established a career building
  full-stack technologies. Professionally, I currently enjoy developing JavaScript applications. I'm amazed at the versatility
  of JS, spanning from principled client frameworks like AngularJS and React, to server execution and communication with NodeJS
  and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), to 100s of middleware in between (and on top of). My hobbies coincide with my
  idea of holistic development as well; I have a fascination with how the Internet of Things will integrate with and improve
  life as we know it.
