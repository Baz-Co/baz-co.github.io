      <p>A rudimentry understanding of the many religions in our world is an important facet of a well-rounded existance. Far too often I have found myself wishing I had more knowledge of the tenaments, icons, and fundementals of major religions. Here I will organize my research and discoveries; both as a fact board for myself and hopefully a utility collection for you.

        <a name="Buddhism" /><h2>Buddhism</h2>
        <p><i>Buddhism is a type of spirituality that helps to bring greater meaning to human life.</i> Buddhism is a free-forming philisophy more than a religion. Followers of the philosphy seek peaceful minds and a life of moderate living.</p>
        <p><i>Some of the key virtues of Buddhism are kindness, awareness, and wisdom. Wisdom is an interdependency between intelligence, or knowledge, and emotional awareness. It is wisdom that allows us to make best choices as we interact with others in our world.</i></p>

        <h4>3 Jewels</h4>
        <p>The three realms of the buddhist faith.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Buddha</li>
          <p>Buddha's full name was "Siddhartha Gautama", and is also known as "Shakyamuni." He was born in Nepal over 2,500 years ago to a royal family that resided in the Himalayan foothills. Siddhartha was afforded all the luxuries of a prince and was groomed by his father to take the reins as the patriarch of the well established family. Gautama was sheltered from the unpleasant realities of life in his younger years. It wasn't until after the age of 16, Shakyamuni left the confines of his palace to be startled by what he declared as the 4 signs: an old man, a sick person, a corpse, and a monk. It was after this excursion Siddhartha renounced his lavish life to seek out a more pure, modest one; at the age of 29, despite being a declared succussor and having a wife and son, he left the palace and his family for an ascetic life.</p>
          <p>Just the same as Gautama's previous lavish life, he found that his pauper life too wasn't spiritually fulfiling. It wasn't until the age of 35, that Shakyamuni achieved enlightment and became what we now-a-days reffer to as the Buddha. It was through years of deep meditation that Buddha forged his understandings of a fulfiling, spiritual life that he deemed "The Middle Way."</p>
          <p>Buddha is not a savior; he is an icon that achieved enlightenment and shared his discoveries with others who seek spiritual fulfilment. <i>Buddhism doesn't have a concept of a savior because it requires followers to to learn how to save themselves.</i></p>
          <li>Dharma</li>
          <li>Sangha</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>3 Evil Roots</h4>
        <p>The three evil roots exist in all humans. In a path to enlightenment one must idenify and work to release themselves from thier snare.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Illusionment</li>
          <li>Hartred</li>
          <li>Anger</li>
